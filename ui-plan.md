# UI Component Plan - LMS Project

## Objective
The goal of this phase is to design a clean and scalable user interface structure for the Learning Management System (LMS). The focus is on layout, reusability, and responsivenessâ€”not full functionality.

## Planned Components

### **1. Navbar**
- Appears on all pages (except login).
- Includes site logo, navigation links (Home, Dashboard, Courses, Profile, Logout).

### **2. Footer**
- Displays copyright and footer links.
- Responsive and consistent across pages.

### **3. Button (Reusable)**
- Can be customized using props (label, variant, size).
- Used across login, dashboard, and course components.

### **4. Input (Reusable)**
- For text fields, email, and password inputs.
- Accepts props for type, placeholder, and label.

### **5. DashboardLayout**
- Wraps dashboard pages with Navbar, Sidebar (optional), and Footer.
- Provides consistent structure across student/admin dashboards.

## **Page-Level Components**

### **Login Page**
- Contains Input and Button components.
- Centered responsive layout.

### **Dashboard Page**
- Displays user greeting and a placeholder for courses or stats.
- Wrapped in DashboardLayout.

## **Layout and Styling Plan**
- Tailwind CSS for styling and responsiveness.
- Use Flexbox and Grid for layout.
- Apply consistent color scheme, spacing, and typography.

---

## **Responsive Design**
- Test for:
  - Mobile: 375px width
  - Tablet: 768px width
  - Desktop: 1440px width

---

## **Next Steps**
1. Implement each component in `/components` folder.
2. Use them inside `app/page.js` and `app/dashboard/page.js`.
3. Verify the layout using `npm run dev`.
